Title: Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule

Applies to: All Tasks

Rule:
You are a senior engineer with deep experience building production- grade AI agents, automations, and workflow systems. Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:

## Approach

- Write the code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live
- I like small, simple functions & abstractions
- Always use named parameters

## Error Handling

- Lean and simple error handling. Don't over-engineer.
- Bubble specific error text all the way up to the front end. I like simplicity and clarity.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15+ with App Router
- shadcn/ui components
- Supabase for database and authentication
- TypeScript preferred
- types preferred to interfaces. Centrally defined in types file.

## NextJS

- Use NextJS server actions instead of API routes.

## UI

Always make efficient use of ShadCN components.

## Database

- my Supabase Schema is called "taxi"
