### User Workflows (As They Work Today)

#### Challenge & Play Workflow
1. User views ladder and identifies opponent within challenge range
2. Clicks player name to open player sheet
3. Clicks "Challenge Player" button to send challenge
4. System creates pending match record
5. Both players see each other's contact information
6. Players coordinate match externally (phone/WhatsApp/email)
7. Winner returns to app and submits result via "Submit Result" button
8. System records winner, score, and completion date
9. Ladder positions remain static (no automatic reranking implemented)

#### Current Limitations & Gaps
