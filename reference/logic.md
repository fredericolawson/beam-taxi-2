## Ladder logic

ladderRank is inverted â€” 1 is the best ranked player
I can challenge people up to three positions better than me
If I beat the person I challenge, I take their ladder rank. They and everyone between them and me moves down one position.
ladder_rank is a field on the player record in Supabase
